# React Learning - Brushing up

A small React learning project. This repository currently contains basic frontend files such as `index.html`, `App.js`, and `index.css`.

**Repository**: `https://github.com/PradeepVerma-55/react-app.git`

**Project Setup**
- **Prerequisites**: Node.js (recommended) and a package manager (`npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`) if you plan to install dependencies. If this is a static demo, you can open `index.html` directly in a browser.
- **Clone**:

```
git clone https://github.com/PradeepVerma-55/react-app.git
cd react-app
```

**Install & Run**
- If this project has a `package.json` (React app created via CRA/Vite/etc.), run:

```
npm install
npm start        # or `npm run dev` if using Vite
```

- If there is no `package.json`, open `index.html` in your browser to view the demo.

**Build**

```
npm run build
```

Only run the above if a build script exists in `package.json`.

**Initial Git commands (what you ran)**
You initialized the repo locally and pushed the initial commit to GitHub. For reference, here are the exact commands you ran:

```
git init
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m "hello world !"
git remote add origin https://github.com/PradeepVerma-55/react-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

These created the initial commit and pushed the `main` branch to the `origin` remote.

**Git Cheat Sheet (quick)**
- `git status` — show repository status
- `git add <file|.>` — stage changes
- `git commit -m "msg"` — commit staged changes
- `git push` / `git pull` — sync with remote
- `git branch` / `git checkout <branch>` or `git switch <branch>` — branch management
- `git stash` / `git stash pop` — save/restore work-in-progress
- `git reflog` — recover lost refs/commits

**Notes & Next Steps**
- If you want me to, I can:
	- update this README further with project-specific commands after you confirm the package manager and dev command, or
	- create a `package.json` (if you want to initialize with `npm init -y`) and add a simple `start` script, then commit & push those changes.

Replace `<repo-url>` placeholders above with your preferred remote URL if needed.

If you'd like, I can commit any further README edits and push them to `origin/main` now.
